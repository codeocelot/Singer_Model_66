## What Your Machine Will and Won't Do

Your Singer Model 66 was designed and likely built well before the first computer so don't expect all the modern amenities that brand new machines might have. It will, however, reliably produce beautiful chain stitches.

### What it won't do

#### Reverse

Before reverse gears, sewers backtacked by stopping the machine with the needle down and into the fabric, lifting the presser foot, rotating the material 180 degrees, lower the presser foot and continuing to sew. Reverse gears are convenient, but certainly not necessary.  It's best practice to go back-and-forth a few times when you begin and end a seam.  At first, having to rotate the fabric 180 degrees will be awkward but in time will become less cumbersome.  Stick with it!

#### Zig-Zags, Fancy Stitches & Buttons

Out of the box, a Model 66 is incapable of anything but a straight stitch. The caveat is that later, Singer sold attachments that enabled a number of interesting stitches.

#### Lowering Feed Dogs

Feed dogs are the little feet that rise and move your fabric as you stitch.  On a Model 66, the feed dogs aren't easily lowered. This is only a problem when doing buttonholes and embroidery. Fortunately, Singer sold feed dog covers, however, these are quite rare and can easily cost quite a lot of money to buy-- if you can actually find one.  Luckily, if you find a Singer Buttonholer case, it'll come with a feed dog cover.  I bought my buttonholer for <$20 on eBay.  If you're interested in embroidery or buttons, this is a highly useful accessory to purchase.
