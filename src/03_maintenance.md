### Maintenance

Singer Model 66 machines, if made in the modern day, would probably classify as light industrial machines.  They are made almost exclusively of metal and given the right care, can have a lifespan measured in centuries. In contrast most modern home sewing machines have key parts made of plastic and consequently, have lifespans measured in mere years.

#### Oil

You should periodically oil your machine. Luckily, this is pretty easy. Consult your manual (or an online edition) the first couple times you do it. The gist is that there's holes all over your machine, simply squirt a bit of oil into each hole and turn the balance wheel to ensure the internals are well coated.

One thing to note is under your machine's sliding cover, just in front of where the bobbin goes, there's a small bit of fabric. This is *not* something that errantly got there and you should not attempt to remove it. It's actually a mini-resevoir of oil to keep the bobbin case well lubricated. When oiling your machine, be sure to give it a good squirt to soak the fabric.
