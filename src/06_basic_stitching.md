## Basic Stitching

### Inserting a needle

When inserting the needle, I find having the clamp already in place makes it much easier.  Simply loosen the clamp screw, and insert the needle.  Remember to always place the needle's flat size pointing to the right. It's beyond my pay-grade to know why, but failure to do this will cause skipped stitches.

### Threading the machine

Your manual covers this section very well. I'd recommend practicing this until it becomes second nature, because you'll be doing this a lot, and rethreading is certainly one of those skills you should pick up early on in your sewing career.
