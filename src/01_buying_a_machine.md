## Buying a machine

Model 66 machines can be treadle, electric motor or hand crank powered; and, they originally were manufactured with a number of cases, ranging from utilitarian boxes to elegant desks.  Fundamentally, the machine itself varies very little between these variants.

### Power

As mentioned, Model 66 machines can come powered by a treadle, electric motor or hand crank. One may fairly easy convert a machine from one source of power to another. The one caveat is that a treadle requires a cabinet capable of housing the required foot pedal. For this reason, it's unlikely that most will convert to treadle power, but it is entirely possible with enough gumption.

#### Electric Motor

!!! Make sure you unplug your machine before repairing, replacing or inspecting anything to do with the knee controller, foot controller or electric motor. These machines route the entire 120v wall outlet power through the controller and into the machine. A shock with this much power can easily kill you !!!

My machine came from the factory with an electric motor, for that reason this is the power method I'm most familiar with.  Machines with an electric motor can either be controlled with a foot or knee controller.

#### Treadle

Older Model 66s came powered by a foot powered treadle. Using a treadle requires a bit of coordination when rhythmically pushing down on the foot pedal.

#### Hand Crank

All Model 66s can be manually controlled by rotating the balance wheel.  Machines equiped with a hand crank simply have a rotating lever attached to this same balance wheel so you can spin the balance wheel at a faster rate.

### Cases and Cabinets

Model 66 machines were shipped from the factory in a plethora of different boxes and cabinets, ranging from simple wooden frames to extensive home sewing desks and even industrial purpose sewing tables. If your machine comes with an original housing and it fits in your space, you should try to keep the machine in its original home. Cabinets made for these machines are usually made of good quality materials and are of high quality. It's unlikely you'll build something better, and, unlike modern table-top machines, you'll need a cabinet of some kind for the machine to work.

If you bought your machine without a case, not all is lost. Building a simple wooden housing for your machine is fairly straight-forward with basic wood-working stills. All that's required is a simple housing that will support your machine and allow the levers under the machine to move freely throughout their entire range of motion.
