## Winding the Bobbin

Before sewing, you need to wind a bobbin with thread. Luckily, this is an easy and fun process, but can take a bit of practice to get right.

Before you begin, check that the bobbin winder is disengaged and the pawl is up.  To do this, simply push on the pawl, it shouldn't move.  If it does, the bobbin winder was engaged, but has now just unengaged.  You can also verify the winder is disengaged by spinning the balance wheel. When you do this, check that nothing on the bobbin winder touches the balance wheel, and while the balance wheel moves, the bobbin winder does not.

To wind your bobbin, start by placing a spool of thread on the spindle on the top of the machine.  Guide the thread through the stationary hook on the head of the machine, then go rightwards until you reach the bobbin winder area, then thread it through the two guides.  Now thread the end through one of the bigger holes in the bobbin, then put the bobbin onto the spindle.  Next, while gently pushing down, rotate the bobbin until it 'clicks' into position.  Engage the winder by pushing down anywhere on the winder assembly, it should stay in the down position.  You're now ready to wind the bobbin.

I'd recommend starting the wind by slowly rotating the balance wheel by hand so you can ensure the bobbin is winding correctly. When you're happy with how the bobbin is winding, you can switch to using the treadle, electric motor or hand crank, which ever your machine has. Continue winding until your bobbin is full of thread.

To disengage, simply push up on the pawl, cut the thread and remove the filled bobbin.

I like to store my most used spools of thread with a wound bobbin, as this streamlines my work when switching threads.
