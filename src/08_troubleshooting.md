## Troubleshooting

Troubleshooting a sewing machine can be a frustrating experience.  Luckily, I find the following checklist can debug most issues I've encountered.

### Skipped Stitches

- Before doing anything else, completely rethread the machine.  Remember to take the needle up to it's highest point before rethreading. 
- Ensure the needle is inserted with flat side on the right.
- Check that there are no loose threads clogging the bobbin cover area.
- Replace needle.  In my experince blunt or bent needles are a major source of skipped threads.

### Broken thread

Follow the above steps for broken threads, double checking that your thread hasn't come off the thread tensioner.  If the issue isn't resolved, then turn the thread tensioner dial back a little at a time, until threads are well formed.
