## Stitch Length, Thread Tension and Foot Pressure

### Stitch Length

Stitch length can be adjusted by rotating the stitch length knob on the base of the sewing machine.  Somewhat paradoxically to me, thread length is maximized when the knob is completely screwed inwards.  Loosening the screw decreases thread length.

If you're lucky enough to have a model with a lever instead of a knob, it should be intuitive enough to adjust the thread length.
