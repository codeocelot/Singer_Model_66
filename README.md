# One Person's Guide to Restoring a Vintage Singer Model 66 Sewing Machine

So you're interested in restoring an antique Singer 66 sewing machine. Maybe you've already purchased it and it's been sitting idle in your house, waiting for you figure out how to restore and use it.  Maybe you've come across a beautiful (or not so beautiful) machine online or in a local used market. The following guide documents one person's experience buying, restoring and using such a machine.

Much of this guide is also applicable to Model 99 machines, which is simply a smaller, more portable version using all the same parts as a Model 66. This guide may also be helpful for those looking to restore a Singer Model 15, 27, 127, 128 and possibly other similar vintage Singer machines.

## Structure of the Guide

The contents of this guide stem from my project to restore and operate an antique sewing machine. For this reason, there will certainly be omissions in places where I haven't or needed to figure out yet.  You can help by contributing to this guide.

The manual to your machine is a vital source of knowledge, for brievity this guide assumes you have read the manual and will not repeat knowledge well explained in the manual.

This project is written in Markdown, hosted on Github and compiles to a number of document formats. If you have suggestions or edits, please either open an issue or pull request with your changes.

This guide is divided into logical sections. We start by discussing sourcing and buying a machine, determining what parts are possibly missing or need replacement and continue into using the machine in a number of different ways.
