Person’s Guide to Restoring a Vintage Singer Model 66 Sewing
Machine</h1>
<p>So you’re interested in restoring an antique Singer 66 sewing
machine. Maybe you’ve already purchased it and it’s been sitting idle in
your house, waiting for you figure out how to restore and use it. Maybe
you’ve come across a beautiful (or not so beautiful) machine online or
in a local used market. The following guide documents one person’s
experience buying, restoring and using such a machine.</p>
<p>Much of this guide is also applicable to Model 99 machines, which is
simply a smaller, more portable version using all the same parts as a
Model 66. This guide may also be helpful for those looking to restore a
Singer Model 15, 27, 127, 128 and possibly other similar vintage Singer
machines.</p>
<h2 id="structure-of-the-guide">Structure of the Guide</h2>
<p>The contents of this guide stem from my project to restore and
operate an antique sewing machine. For this reason, there will certainly
be omissions in places where I haven’t or needed to figure out yet. You
can help by contributing to this guide.</p>
<p>The manual to your machine is a vital source of knowledge, for
brievity this guide assumes you have read the manual and will not repeat
knowledge well explained in the manual.</p>
<p>This project is written in Markdown, hosted on Github and compiles to
a number of document formats. If you have suggestions or edits, please
either open an issue or pull request with your changes.</p>
<p>This guide is divided into logical sections. We start by discussing
sourcing and buying a machine, determining what parts are possibly
missing or need replacement and continue into using the machine in a
number of different ways.</p>

<h2 id="buying-a-machine">Buying a machine</h2>
<p>Model 66 machines can be treadle, electric motor or hand crank
powered; and, they originally were manufactured with a number of cases,
ranging from utilitarian boxes to elegant desks. Fundamentally, the
machine itself varies very little between these variants.</p>
<h3 id="power">Power</h3>
<p>As mentioned, Model 66 machines can come powered by a treadle,
electric motor or hand crank. One may fairly easy convert a machine from
one source of power to another. The one caveat is that a treadle
requires a cabinet capable of housing the required foot pedal. For this
reason, it’s unlikely that most will convert to treadle power, but it is
entirely possible with enough gumption.</p>
<h4 id="electric-motor">Electric Motor</h4>
<p>!!! Make sure you unplug your machine before repairing, replacing or
inspecting anything to do with the knee controller, foot controller or
electric motor. These machines route the entire 120v wall outlet power
through the controller and into the machine. A shock with this much
power can easily kill you !!!</p>
<p>My machine came from the factory with an electric motor, for that
reason this is the power method I’m most familiar with. Machines with an
electric motor can either be controlled with a foot or knee
controller.</p>
<h5 id="two--vs-three-lead-controllers">Two- vs Three-lead
controllers</h5>
<p>TODO</p>
<h4 id="treadle">Treadle</h4>
<p>Older Model 66s came powered by a foot powered treadle. Using a
treadle requires a bit of coordination when rhythmically pushing down on
the foot pedal.</p>
<h4 id="hand-crank">Hand Crank</h4>
<p>All Model 66s can be manually controlled by rotating the balance
wheel. Machines equiped with a hand crank simply have a rotating lever
attached to this same balance wheel so you can spin the balance wheel at
a faster rate.</p>
<h3 id="cases-and-cabinets">Cases and Cabinets</h3>
<p>Model 66 machines were shipped from the factory in a plethora of
different boxes and cabinets, ranging from simple wooden frames to
extensive home sewing desks and even industrial purpose sewing tables.
If your machine comes with an original housing and it fits in your
space, you should try to keep the machine in its original home. Cabinets
made for these machines are usually made of good quality materials and
are of high quality. It’s unlikely you’ll build something better, and,
unlike modern table-top machines, you’ll need a cabinet of some kind for
the machine to work.</p>
<p>I’ve had great success restoring my cabinet with Restor-A-Finish and
a fine steel wool.</p>
<p>If you bought your machine without a case, not all is lost. Building
a simple wooden housing for your machine should be fairly
straight-forward with basic wood-working stills. All that’s required is
a simple housing that will support your machine and allow the levers
under the machine to move freely throughout their entire range of
motion.</p>
<h2 id="buying-parts">Buying parts</h2>
<p>My machine was missing several parts when I bought it. Determining
what I needed to replace without having a complete, working machine to
reference was a challenge, and probably one of the biggest reasons why
my machine sat dormant for several years before I had the gumption to
dive in. Hopefully this guide will help you figure out what parts you
need to buy so you don’t need to experience the same daunting challenges
I did.</p>
<p>Luckily, Model 66 machines are built very well by modern standards,
and it’s unlikely that it’s internals need significant replacement. More
likely, you may be missing some peripheral pieces.</p>
<h3 id="bobbin-sliding-cover-sliding-cover-spring">Bobbin, Sliding Cover
&amp; Sliding Cover Spring</h3>
<p>My machine did not come with a bobbin nor a sliding cover for where
the bobbin goes. Luckily these are readily replacable parts. Sliding
covers can be purchased online from Central Michigan Sewing Supplies or
elsewhere. You should also check to ensure you have a sliding cover
‘spring’– in actuality it’s a mostly flat bar, afixed to the base of the
machine and who’s ends bent upwards into grooves in the sliding cover.
It can be very tricky to get the spring’s ends to fit into the cover’s
grooves.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the Model 66 revolutionized and ushered in modern
bobbin designs. Go into any sewing or fabric store and you’ll readily
find ‘Class 66’ bobbins. All of them (as far as I know) will fit into
your machine. You’ll probably want more than one, since you’ll probably
want to use more than one type or colour of thread.</p>
<p>Replacing the slide cover can be a little tricky when getting the
spring arms into their grooves. I find it easiest to hold the cover to
the right of where it goes, at an angle pointing upwards to the right.
With the grooves close to the spring arms, use an old bobby pin or
similar to gentley push the arms into place. Then carefully lower and
push the cover leftwards into place. This can be especially tricky if
you’ve just replaced the spring, but keep at it, and it should
eventually work.</p>

<h3 id="maintenance">Maintenance</h3>
<p>Singer Model 66 machines, if made in the modern day, would probably
classify as light industrial machines. They are made almost exclusively
of metal and given the right care, can have a lifespan measured in
centuries. In contrast, most modern home sewing machines have key parts
made of plastic and consequently, have lifespans measured in mere
years.</p>
<h4 id="oil">Oil</h4>
<p>You should periodically oil your machine. Luckily, this is pretty
easy. Consult your manual (or an online edition) the first couple times
you do it. The gist is that there’s holes all over your machine, simply
squirt a bit of oil into each hole and turn the balance wheel to ensure
the internals are well coated.</p>
<p>One thing to note is under your machine’s sliding cover, just in
front of where the bobbin goes, there’s a small bit of fabric. This is
<em>not</em> something that errantly got there and you should not
attempt to remove it. It’s actually a mini-resevoir of oil to keep the
bobbin case well lubricated. When oiling your machine, be sure to give
it a good squirt to soak the fabric.</p>
<h2 id="what-your-machine-will-and-wont-do">What Your Machine Will and
Won’t Do</h2>
<p>Your Singer Model 66 was designed and likely built well before the
first computer so don’t expect all the modern amenities that brand new
machines might have. It will, however, reliably produce beautiful chain
stitches.</p>
<h3 id="what-it-wont-do">What it won’t do</h3>
<h4 id="reverse">Reverse</h4>
<p>Before reverse gears, sewers backtacked by stopping the machine with
the needle down and into the fabric, lifting the presser foot, rotating
the material 180 degrees, lower the presser foot and continuing to sew.
Reverse gears are convenient, but certainly not necessary. It’s best
practice to go back-and-forth a few times when you begin and end a seam.
At first, having to rotate the fabric 180 degrees will be awkward but in
time will become less cumbersome. Stick with it!</p>
<h4 id="zig-zags-fancy-stitches-buttons">Zig-Zags, Fancy Stitches &amp;
Buttons</h4>
<p>Out of the box, a Model 66 is incapable of anything but a straight
stitch. The caveat is that later, Singer sold attachments that enabled a
number of interesting stitches.</p>
<h4 id="lowering-feed-dogs">Lowering Feed Dogs</h4>
<p>Feed dogs are the little feet that rise and move your fabric as you
stitch. On a Model 66, the feed dogs aren’t easily lowered. This is only
a problem when doing buttonholes and embroidery. Fortunately, Singer
sold feed dog covers, however, these are quite rare and can easily cost
quite a lot of money to buy– if you can actually find one. Luckily, if
you find a Singer Buttonholer case, it’ll come with a feed dog cover. I
bought my buttonholer for &lt;$20 on eBay. If you’re interested in
embroidery or buttons, this is a highly useful accessory to
purchase.</p>
<h2 id="winding-the-bobbin">Winding the Bobbin</h2>
<p>Before sewing, you need to wind a bobbin with thread. Luckily, this
is an easy and fun process, but can take a bit of practice to get
right.</p>
<p>Before you begin, check that the bobbin winder is disengaged and the
pawl is up. To do this, simply push on the pawl, it shouldn’t move. If
it does, the bobbin winder was engaged, but has now just unengaged. You
can also verify the winder is disengaged by spinning the balance wheel.
When you do this, check that nothing on the bobbin winder touches the
balance wheel, and while the balance wheel moves, the bobbin winder does
not.</p>
<p>To wind your bobbin, start by placing a spool of thread on the
spindle on the top of the machine. Guide the thread through the
stationary hook on the head of the machine, then go rightwards until you
reach the bobbin winder area, then thread it through the two guides. Now
thread the end through one of the bigger holes in the bobbin, then put
the bobbin onto the spindle. Next, while gently pushing down, rotate the
bobbin until it ‘clicks’ into position. Engage the winder by pushing
down anywhere on the winder assembly, it should stay in the down
position. You’re now ready to wind the bobbin.</p>
<p>I’d recommend starting the wind by slowly rotating the balance wheel
by hand so you can ensure the bobbin is winding correctly. When you’re
happy with how the bobbin is winding, you can switch to using the
treadle, electric motor or hand crank, which ever your machine has.
Continue winding until your bobbin is full of thread.</p>
<p>To disengage, simply push up on the pawl, cut the thread and remove
the filled bobbin.</p>
<p>I like to store my most used spools of thread with a wound bobbin, as
this streamlines my work when switching threads.</p>
<h2 id="basic-stitching">Basic Stitching</h2>
<h3 id="inserting-a-needle">Inserting a needle</h3>
<p>When inserting the needle, I find having the clamp already in place
makes it much easier. Simply loosen the clamp screw, and insert the
needle. Remember to always place the needle’s flat size pointing to the
right. It’s beyond my pay-grade to know why, but failure to do this will
cause skipped stitches.</p>
<h3 id="threading-the-machine">Threading the machine</h3>
<p>Your manual covers this section very well. I’d recommend practicing
this until it becomes second nature, because you’ll be doing this a lot,
and rethreading is certainly one of those skills you should pick up
early on in your sewing career.</p>
<h2 id="stitch-length-thread-tension-and-foot-pressure">Stitch Length,
Thread Tension and Foot Pressure</h2>
<h3 id="stitch-length">Stitch Length</h3>
<p>Stitch length can be adjusted by rotating the stitch length knob on
the base of the sewing machine. Somewhat paradoxically to me, thread
length is maximized when the knob is completely screwed inwards.
Loosening the screw decreases thread length.</p>
<p>If you’re lucky enough to have a model with a lever instead of a
knob, it should be intuitive enough to adjust the thread length.</p>
<h3 id="thread-tension">Thread Tension</h3>
<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>Troubleshooting a sewing machine can be a frustrating experience.
Luckily, I find the following checklist can debug most issues I’ve
encountered.</p>
<h3 id="skipped-stitches">Skipped Stitches</h3>
<ul>
<li>Before doing anything else, completely rethread the machine.
Remember to take the needle up to it’s highest point before
rethreading.</li>
<li>Ensure the needle is inserted with flat side on the right.</li>
<li>Check that there are no loose threads clogging the bobbin cover
area.</li>
<li>Replace needle. In my experince blunt or bent needles are a major
source of skipped threads.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="broken-thread">Broken thread</h3>
<p>Follow the above steps for broken threads, double checking that your
thread hasn’t come off the thread tensioner. If the issue isn’t
resolved, then turn the thread tensioner dial back a little at a time,
until threads are well formed.</p>
